# Level bonus

Small script that solves a puzzle that I should not have clicked...

## Steps

```shell 
bundle install
ruby crazy_cars.rb [Options]
```

### Options

Crazy cars solver use the gem Thor as CLI so, you can see the different options by typing:

```shell 
ruby crazy_cars.rb -h
```

#### Download images

Before viewing the hidden message you need to download the images like that:

```shell 
ruby crazy_cars.rb -dl
```

#### Display secret message

Now you can see the message with the display option:

```shell 
ruby crazy_cars.rb -d
```

*I tried to do something that can display the message in less than a minute :rocket: and my focus was really not about reusable or beautiful code*

:warning: *Do not drive too fast !*

By the way, I heard about a free drink ?! If it's true, I'd be happy to meet you in March ?!
